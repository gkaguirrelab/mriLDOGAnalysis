If a different analysis procedure than the one specified in the readme file is used, specify it on this document.

JUNE 7

This is the first experiment. It only contains acquisitions with AP direction since the PA scanning protocol did not work at the time. Therefore, no topup was performed on the data. Additionally, the single-rep EPI image is not exactly in the same alignment with the MPRAGE image but rather tilted slightly which causes the blobs to appear more superior in the brain than they should be (fix in progress). Apart from these modifications, the procedure in the readme file was followed for the rest of the analysis.

JULY 8 

This scan was performed in three sessions as we encountered a coil plug issue which caused some RF interference in the data. As the scan was interrupted and the subject was registered three times the spatial location of the brain is different between these sessions. Therefore, first, a topup was performed on all three sessions separately using their respective single-rep images. Then, the EPIs from all three sessions were motion corrected using the prime (topup output) of the first session as the reference. Apart from these modifications, the procedure in the readme file was followed for the rest of the analysis.
